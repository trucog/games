# S3

Simple Storage Service, shortened to S3, is one of the oldest services in AWS. S3 stores objects, whatever they may be, and allows you to easily configure who can see them. S3 stores your objects in whichever region you select, which can be important for legal or regulatory reasons. In S3, objects are the fundamental storage structure. An object is basically a file and metadata.

The metadata is used by S3 and includes things like file type and modified date, as well as any custom metadata added. S3 doesn't care what type of object it is, and the maximum file size limit is essentially a joke except in the most extraordinary circumstances.
