# Lamda
AWS Lambda service allows you to run code without provisioning or managing dedicated servers. 

In other words, Lambda will be called Serverless Computing.

The interesting feature about lambda is you only need to pay for the compute time you consume and no need to pay when your code is not running.

you can run code for virtually any type of application with zero administration with the help of AWS Lambda functions.

Just upload your code to Lambda and it will take care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability

We can set triggering events for our lambda function when to run or when to get triggered.

Lambda currently supports various languages such as java, python, node js, c, etc using which you can write your lambda function.
